# 🚲 Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study

## 📊 Project Overview

This case study explores six months of ride data from **Cyclistic**, a Chicago-based bike-share program. The goal is to identify behavioral differences between **casual riders** and **members**, and provide **data-driven recommendations** to help the company increase annual memberships.
